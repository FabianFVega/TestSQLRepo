# TestSQLRepo
In the following repository, you can find a SQL file that has different queries based on the test interview. Please be aware of following the steps for testing the query. 

In my case, I have created and run my code in PHPMYADMIN, which works with XAMPP software. This is the link if you have never worked with: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html

Once you have installed the software, you clip on buttons start of MYSQL  and apache, after that you clip on the button admin, create a data base and run all the code in a terminal web of PHPMYADMIN.

Note: the storage procedures run in a section of rutines and views after run the scrip you will be able to view on the same phpmyadmin.
